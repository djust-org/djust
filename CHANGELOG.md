# Changelog

All notable changes to djust will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Context Processor Support**: LiveView now automatically applies Django context processors configured in `DjustTemplateBackend`. Variables like `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`, `user`, `messages`, etc. are now available in LiveView templates without manual passing. ([#26](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/26))

### Fixed

- **VDOM Cache Key Path Awareness**: Cache keys now include URL path and query string hash, preventing render corruption when navigating between views with different template structures (e.g., `/emails/` vs `/emails/?sender=1`). ([#24](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/24))

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Initial public release
- LiveView reactive server-side rendering
- Rust-powered VDOM engine (10-100x faster than Django templates)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- 40+ UI components (Bootstrap 5 and Tailwind CSS)
- State management decorators (`@state`, `@computed`, `@debounce`, `@optimistic`)
- Form handling with real-time validation
- Testing utilities (`LiveViewTestClient`, snapshot testing)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-22
