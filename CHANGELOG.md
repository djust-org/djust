# Changelog

All notable changes to djust will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Inline Handler Arguments**: Event handlers now support function-call syntax with arguments directly in the template attribute. Use `@click="handler('arg')"` instead of `@click="handler" data-value="arg"`. Supports strings, numbers, booleans, null, and multiple arguments. Arguments are automatically parsed and mapped to handler parameters by position. ([#67](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/67))

## [0.1.6] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- **`{% url %}` Tag Support**: Django's `{% url %}` template tag is now fully supported with automatic Python-side URL resolution. Supports named URLs, namespaced URLs, and positional/keyword arguments. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **`{% include %}` Tag Support**: Fixed template include functionality by passing template directories to the Rust engine. Included templates are now correctly resolved from configured template paths. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **`urlencode` Filter**: Added the `urlencode` filter for URL-safe encoding of strings. Supports encoding all characters or preserving safe characters. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **Comparison Operators in `{% if %}` Tags**: Added support for `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` comparison operators in conditional expressions. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **Auto-serialization for Django Types**: Context variables with Django types (datetime, date, time, Decimal, UUID, FieldFile) are now automatically serialized for Rust rendering. No manual JSON conversion required. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **Lazy Hydration**: LiveView elements can now defer WebSocket connections until they enter the viewport or receive user interaction. Use `data-live-lazy` attribute with modes: `viewport` (default), `click`, `hover`, or `idle`. Reduces memory usage by 20-40% per page for below-fold content. ([#54](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/54))
- **TurboNav Integration**: LiveView now works seamlessly with Turbo-style client-side navigation. WebSocket connections are properly disconnected on navigation and reinitialized when returning to a page. ([#54](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/54))

### Changed

- **AST Optimization**: Template parser now merges adjacent Text nodes during AST optimization, reducing allocations and improving render time by 5-15%. Comment nodes are also removed during optimization as they produce no output. ([#54](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/54))

### Fixed

- **Nested Block Inheritance**: Fixed template inheritance for nested blocks (e.g., `docs_content` inside `content`). Block overrides are now recursively applied to merged content, ensuring deeply nested blocks are correctly resolved. ([#57](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/57))
- **Form Validation First-Click Issue**: Added `parse_html_continue()` function to maintain ID counter continuity across parsing operations. Prevents ID collisions when inserting dynamically generated elements (like validation error messages) that caused first-click validation issues. ([#54](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/54))
- **Whitespace Preservation**: Whitespace is now preserved inside `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<textarea>`, `<script>`, and `<style>` elements during both Rust parsing and client-side DOM patching. ([#54](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/54))

### Security

- **pyo3 Upgrade**: Upgraded pyo3 from 0.22 to 0.24 to address RUSTSEC-2025-0020 (buffer overflow vulnerability in `PyString::from_object`). ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Context Processor Support**: LiveView now automatically applies Django context processors configured in `DjustTemplateBackend`. Variables like `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`, `user`, `messages`, etc. are now available in LiveView templates without manual passing. ([#26](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/26))

### Fixed

- **VDOM Cache Key Path Awareness**: Cache keys now include URL path and query string hash, preventing render corruption when navigating between views with different template structures (e.g., `/emails/` vs `/emails/?sender=1`). ([#24](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/24))

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Initial public release
- LiveView reactive server-side rendering
- Rust-powered VDOM engine (10-100x faster than Django templates)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- 40+ UI components (Bootstrap 5 and Tailwind CSS)
- State management decorators (`@state`, `@computed`, `@debounce`, `@optimistic`)
- Form handling with real-time validation
- Testing utilities (`LiveViewTestClient`, snapshot testing)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
