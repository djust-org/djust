## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`{% url %}` Tag Support**: Django's `{% url %}` template tag is now fully supported with automatic Python-side URL resolution. Supports named URLs, namespaced URLs, and positional/keyword arguments. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **`{% include %}` Tag Support**: Fixed template include functionality by passing template directories to the Rust engine. Included templates are now correctly resolved from configured template paths. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **`urlencode` Filter**: Added the `urlencode` filter for URL-safe encoding of strings. Supports encoding all characters or preserving safe characters. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **Comparison Operators in `{% if %}` Tags**: Added support for `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` comparison operators in conditional expressions. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))
- **Auto-serialization for Django Types**: Context variables with Django types (datetime, date, time, Decimal, UUID, FieldFile) are now automatically serialized for Rust rendering. No manual JSON conversion required. ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))

### Security

- **pyo3 Upgrade**: Upgraded pyo3 from 0.22 to 0.24 to address RUSTSEC-2025-0020 (buffer overflow vulnerability in `PyString::from_object`). ([#55](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/55))

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-23

### Added

- **Context Processor Support**: LiveView now automatically applies Django context processors configured in `DjustTemplateBackend`. Variables like `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`, `user`, `messages`, etc. are now available in LiveView templates without manual passing. ([#26](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/26))

### Fixed

- **VDOM Cache Key Path Awareness**: Cache keys now include URL path and query string hash, preventing render corruption when navigating between views with different template structures (e.g., `/emails/` vs `/emails/?sender=1`). ([#24](https://github.com/djust-org/djust/pull/24))

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- Initial public release
- LiveView reactive server-side rendering
- Rust-powered VDOM engine (10-100x faster than Django templates)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- 40+ UI components (Bootstrap 5 and Tailwind CSS)
- State management decorators (`@state`, `@computed`, `@debounce`, `@optimistic`)
