# ADRs 034–038: implementation sequence

This is an implementation ledger, not acceptance of the complete proposals.
The ADRs remain Proposed until their transport and security gates pass.

## Dependency order

1. ADR-038: typed per-instance state primitives, then separate rendering,
   server persistence, client snapshots and debug projections. Do not expose
   `exposure_policy="explicit"` until every automatic exporter consumes it.
2. ADR-036: shared strict parameter contracts, client collection metadata and
   equivalent validation across all dispatch paths.
3. ADR-035: authorized single-object form lifecycle, consuming the exposure
   contract. Additive public form-construction hooks can land independently.
4. ADR-034: typed component subscriptions, registry-only routing and optional
   client observations; verify two same-type components and stale identities.
5. ADR-037: shared checks and executable documentation throughout these stages;
   finish with catalogue/browser regression coverage and migration guidance.

## Implemented foundation

- Typed `state()` descriptor with instance-owned deep-copied defaults and lazy
  `default_factory`. A consumer mypy regression asserts both accepted reads and
  rejected assignments; nested changes are checked against content fingerprints.
- Public form construction hooks, empty-mapping binding, Django field initial
  values, prefixes and the `_create_form` compatibility bridge. Mount, reset,
  validation, submission and cache reconstruction use the hooks.

These changes **do not** implement exposure permissions, backend capabilities,
managed `self.object`, strict event mode, scoped subscriptions, or no-op client
observations. Legacy exposure and event policies are unchanged. No generators
should use the proposed APIs yet.

## Readiness audit

The milestone-audit checklist was applied to the two foundation boundaries.
There are no database schema changes, new Celery tasks, or auditlog registrations
in this slice. Existing state decorators, private field storage, context
descriptor discovery, form caches and legacy overrides were identified before
implementation. No new third-party runtime dependencies are introduced.

The remaining exposure work must inventory actual sinks, not just callers:
HTTP sessions, WebSocket/actor persistence, signed snapshots, reconnect/live
navigation, embedded state, time-travel, debug output and component providers.
Server-only data cannot be placed in readable signed cookies. Registration and
restore must fail closed without turning an unavailable provider into a legacy
reflection fallback. These are implementation gates, not completed guarantees.

## Verification boundaries

Tests are in `python/djust/tests/test_state_descriptor_contract.py`,
`test_state_descriptor_typing.py`, and `test_form_hooks_adr035.py`. Run these with
the existing form, decorator, state and WebSocket regression suites. This slice
does not change browser JavaScript and does not establish browser, cross-worker,
or complete explicit-exposure parity.
